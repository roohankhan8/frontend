    <h5>Invention or Innovation. Whatâ€™s the difference?</h5> 
   <p>
    The invention involves engineering and developing a new solution, product, or process. When you improve upon an existing solution, product, or process to solve a problem (for example make it more convenient to increase its uses) it becomes an innovation. An invention is an entirely new solution to a problem, a radically different breakthrough that achieves a unique function. Innovation is an improvement over the existing solution
   </p>
    <h5>Why do inventors record their invention process?</h5> 
   <p>All inventions have a purpose and use. An invention is complete when a successful prototype is ready and the inventor is confident that s/he can make exact copies of it. However, a prototype results from many steps.Inventors record every detail of these steps for many reasons, for example, to be able to replicate the prototype with accuracy; to prove that they went through those steps and so they are the legal inventor of the prototype and to record all learnings that happen in the process. This log is the recorder of your invention. Record each step you did, why you did what you did, how you did it, in whose presence you did it. Tomorrow if this invention becomes BIG, you will be able to use this log to prove you are the inventor. Invention log is also part of the patenting process. </p>
    <h5>How to Use this Record of Invention (ROI)?</h5> 
   <p>The sections of this ROI follow the process of invention. As you move further in the process, keep recording everything, what, why, how, and also who and where, when applicable. One way to figure you are doing everything right is by making sure that you are following the sections in the given sequence and completing a section before moving to the next one. Each team/ project needs to complete one invention log.
